# Creating an YouTube Outro 

## Overview

In this section we will focus on creating an YouTube outro for a YouTube channel with **Canva**. This instruction will help you learn the very basics of Canva

## Steps

1. Make sure you are on the Canva's home page. 
 You can click on [this link](https://www.canva.com/) to make sure you are on the right page.
 

2. Click on the "Create a design" on the top right.

Now you should see the dropdown menu with a search bar.
3. Type in "YouTube Outro" and choose it.

4. Open the template section and type in "Edgy Maximalism". Choose the correct one as it is shown in the picture down below.
