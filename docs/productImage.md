Click the **Text** on the right of the web page. There are three default font sizes for heading, subheading and body text. Here we should click the body text, then it will be added to the board. On the edit bar above the board, you can modify the font, font size and font color, etc.

### 6. Upload Image

You can drag the image from your desktop and drop it on the board,  or use the **Uploads** tool to upload the image. If your account is Canva Pro, you can use the premium tool to remove the image background for increasing the visual effect. In this example, we will find a graphic of a chair without a background in the **Element** and put it in the proper position.
