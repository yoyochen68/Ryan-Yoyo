## Stepï¼š

### 1. Create whiteboard

Create a whiteboard with your referent size by clicking the button **Create a design** located on the top right of the website. In the drop-down menu, there are many size templates you can use directly, or you can customize the size with the width and height of your choice. The size of the example image is 1080px*1080px.

### 2. Select colour

Change the color of the background by clicking the square background color button on the top right, then a color board will be showed up with a search bar. You can pick a color on the color plate or search with the Hex Code. The background color of this image is #dbc1aa.

### 3. Create Shape

Find an arch shape by searching "arch" in the **Elements** on the right. There are many lines and shapes are ready to use in the **Lines & Shapes** section. You can simply drag the shape to the top middle of the board. Next, adjust the height and width to 450 *706 by dragging the white dot in the corner and changing the colour to #a66952.

### 4. Insert Graphic

To get the four graphics that on both sides, you can search "earth", "wave", "recycle" and "leaf" in the **Elements**. When Dragging the items to adjust the position, the purple broken lines will appear and help you to align with other items.

### 5.Insert Text

Click the **Text** on the right of the web page. There are three default font sizes for heading, subheading and body text. Here we should click the body text, then it will be added to the board. On the edit bar above the board, you can modify the font, font size and font color, etc.

### 6. Upload Image

You can drag the image to the board from your desktop or use the **Uploads** tool to upload the image. If your account is Canva Pro, you can use the premium tool to remove the image background for increasing the visual effect. In this example, we will find a graphic of a chair without a background in the **Element** and put it in the proper position.

You can download the final image on the top right of the page.
The way to create the product image of the chair can be applied to any other image creating.
